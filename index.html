I am the oldest child in my family.  I am from India. I came Canada on 17 October 2022. I like to make friends.  I have so many friends in my school. I like to do drawing. I also like to make  pen holder, key holder,... with news paper. I make key chian, bracelet, earrings,... by hand made. I have so much stuff of  art and craft.  This year I made a game.
