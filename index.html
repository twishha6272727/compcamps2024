                My project
             </h3>
             <p>
                I worked on the making game and this website. I learn some stuff on this week like making game, websit, 
                editing photos graphic, 3D printing, codding... I never do the codding this is  first time I did codding.
                 So my game is shoot the rock by the bullet. 
                I make some change in like I did  same color in bullet and player there is a link on the website of my game.
                 I set some my game's photos and also there is a link of my game.

            <h3>Some stuff I like more</h3>
            <p>
                The dragon's color is my favourite color. Also the dargon's wings color is my most favourite color. I
                always
                take photo of butterfly in the google and I try to make butterfly drawing in my skecthbook. I draw the
                madala drawing that's took so much time to do catch up all details. The art and craft I always make when
                I
                am free like on the summer vaction, weekend, holiday,... I am draw mahendi in my hand.  
                These are photos which I try to make it real  in my sketch book. these are the videos which I watch 
                 and try to make it by myself.
                 I am not
                professional
                in that I just like mahendi's smell and color. I always watch video like this in youtube or google.
